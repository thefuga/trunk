# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28 after v0.12 milestone started)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- syntect (Rust) chosen over Shiki (JS) for syntax highlighting -- CSS custom properties compliance, no inline styles
- similar crate chosen for word-level diff -- runs on Rust thread pool, purpose-built iter_inline_changes() API
- Whitespace-ignored diffs disable staging (GitHub Desktop pattern) -- never attempt hunk index remapping

### Pending Todos

None.

### Known Limitations

- SSH_AUTH_SOCK absent when app launched from Finder (not `cargo tauri dev`). Documented as known limitation.

### Blockers/Concerns

(None)
