## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Graph Constants Unit Tests Pass
expected: Run `npx vitest run src/lib/graph-constants.test.ts` — all 12 tests pass, covering both existing and overlay constants.
result: pass

### 2. Full Test Suite Passes
expected: Run the full test suite — all 37+ tests pass with no regressions.
result: pass

### 3. Build Succeeds
expected: Run the project build — it completes without errors.
result: pass

### 4. App Loads with Commit Graph
expected: Start the app and navigate to a view with the commit graph. The graph renders commit rows as before — no visual regression from vendoring VirtualList.
result: pass

### 5. SVG Overlay Visible (Red Tint)
expected: With the commit graph visible, you should see a barely-visible red tint across the graph area (0.03 opacity). It may be very subtle — look closely or inspect the DOM for an SVG element with a red rect inside the virtual list's content div.
result: issue
reported: "sorry I can't see it, maybe make it more visible."
severity: minor

### 6. Pointer Events Pass Through Overlay
expected: Click on commit rows in the graph. Clicks work normally — the SVG overlay does not intercept mouse events. Rows are selectable/clickable as if the overlay isn't there.
result: pass

### 7. Scroll Sync — Overlay Moves with Content
expected: Scroll the commit graph. The SVG overlay scrolls in sync with the commit rows — it doesn't stay fixed or lag behind. The red tint (if visible) moves with the content.
result: pass

## Gaps

- truth: "SVG overlay visible as a barely-visible red tint across the graph area"
  status: resolved
  reason: "User reported: sorry I can't see it, maybe make it more visible."
  severity: minor
  test: 5
  root_cause: "Opacity 0.03 is below human perception threshold on dark backgrounds (~ΔE 1.5 vs ~2.3 JND). SVG is also narrow (maxColumns * 12px). Plumbing is correct — snippet IS rendered, SVG IS in DOM."
  artifacts:
    - path: "src/components/CommitGraph.svelte"
      issue: "graphOverlay snippet uses rgba(255,0,0,0.03) — functionally invisible"
      lines: "420-430"
  missing:
    - "Increase opacity to 0.10-0.15 for verifiable visibility on dark backgrounds"
  debug_session: ""
