## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. SVG Overlay Renders
expected: Open the app and navigate to a repository with commits. The commit graph should show an SVG overlay on top of the existing rendering — you should see colored lane rails (vertical lines), bezier curve connections between branches, and commit dots.
result: issue
reported: "it's to the side, not on top"
severity: major

### 2. Normal Commit Dots
expected: Regular (non-merge, non-WIP, non-stash) commits appear as filled colored circles in the SVG overlay. Each dot is solid/filled with the lane color.
result: pass

### 3. Merge Commit Dots
expected: Merge commits (commits with two parents) appear as hollow circles — the center is transparent (showing the background), with only a colored ring/stroke visible. They should look visually distinct from normal filled dots.
result: pass

### 4. WIP Commit Dot
expected: If you have uncommitted changes, the WIP entry at the top of the graph appears as a hollow dashed circle — the stroke is drawn with a dash pattern (gaps in the ring), making it look distinct from merge commits.
result: pass

### 5. Stash Commit Dots
expected: Stash entries appear as filled colored squares (rectangles) rather than circles, making them visually distinguishable from all commit types.
result: pass

### 6. Viewport Virtualization
expected: Scroll through a repository with many commits (100+). The SVG overlay should only render elements visible in the current viewport — the DOM node count should stay bounded regardless of total commit count (no performance degradation on scroll).
result: issue
reported: "for some reason commit dots are disappearing when I scroll (branch lines as well)"
severity: major
