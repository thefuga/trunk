# Tech tracking

  patterns:

key-decisions:
  - "Generalized the existing mutate_session_rmw rather than cloning a sibling RMW (one function, five callers)"
  - "save_draft_comment does NOT emit session-changed (drafts not panel-visible until Phase 69; per-keystroke emits would cause reload storms)"
  - "Skipped the optional REFACTOR step: the 3-line canonical-resolution prelude is clearer left inline, matching every sibling thin command"

patterns-established:
  - "Dumb writer: add_comment_inner persists a fully-formed Anchor (source/side set by the TS adapter), so Phase 68 reuses it verbatim"
  - "Draft/Comment schema asymmetry honored: DraftComment carries text+anchor only, no cached_excerpt"

# Phase 67 Plan 02: add_comment + save_draft_comment Summary

**Two thin Tauri commands (add_comment submits + clears draft and emits; save_draft_comment persists keystrokes silently) over a generalized mutate_session_rmw, with the anchor persisted verbatim to lock the Phase-68 dumb-writer contract.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~6 min
- **Started:** 2026-05-25T16:57:02+02:00 (RED)
- **Completed:** 2026-05-25T17:03:31+02:00 (GREEN)
- **Tasks:** 1 TDD feature (RED → GREEN)
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- `add_comment_inner` pushes a fully-formed `Comment` (anchor + cached_excerpt) and clears the single `draft_comment` slot, all inside the serialized RMW critical section so concurrent submits never lose a write.
- `save_draft_comment_inner` writes/replaces the `draft_comment` slot (text + anchor only — schema asymmetry honored) and does NOT emit `session-changed`.
- Generalized `mutate_session_rmw` from `FnOnce(&mut Vec<String>)` to `FnOnce(&mut ReviewSession)` and adapted the three existing callers (`seed_review_range_rmw`, `add_review_commit_rmw`, `remove_review_commit_rmw`) — one RMW function, no clone.
- 9 new Rust tests lock SC-1 (persist comment + clear draft), SC-2 (six-field anchor round-trip), SC-3/L-08 (Source::FullFile persisted unchanged), concurrency (50 concurrent submits all survive on disk), and T-67-02 (path-traversal `../../etc/passwd` round-trips verbatim while the on-disk filename stays the 16-hex FNV-1a hash).
- Both commands registered in the `lib.rs` invoke_handler.

## Task Commits

TDD cycle (test → feat):

1. **RED — failing tests for add_comment + save_draft_comment** - `83655fe` (test)
2. **GREEN — implement commands + generalize RMW** - `48c26ad` (feat)

_REFACTOR step intentionally skipped — see Decisions._

## Files Created/Modified
- `src-tauri/src/commands/review.rs` - Generalized `mutate_session_rmw`; added `AddCommentRequest`/`SaveDraftCommentRequest` DTOs, `add_comment_inner`/`save_draft_comment_inner` cores, `add_comment`/`save_draft_comment` thin commands, and 9 `#[cfg(test)]` tests.
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Registered `add_comment` + `save_draft_comment` in the invoke_handler.

## Decisions Made
- **Generalize, don't clone:** the plan's truth L-mutate_session_rmw mandated one function; generalizing the closure type to `&mut ReviewSession` keeps a single RMW serving commits, comments, and drafts.
- **No emit on draft:** per RESEARCH Q3, `save_draft_comment` ends after the RMW with no `app.emit`, while `add_comment` emits because a submitted comment is panel-visible.
- **Skip REFACTOR:** the optional dedup of the two commands' canonical-resolution prelude would obscure the thin-command shape that mirrors `add_review_commit`/`remove_review_commit`. Surgical-execution + pattern-consistency favor leaving it inline.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
- **Worktree path confusion (process, not code):** initial `Edit`/`Read` calls used the absolute main-repo path (`/Users/joaofnds/code/trunk/src-tauri/...`) instead of the worktree path, so changes landed in the main repo's working tree. Detected via `git status` showing a clean worktree. Recovered by copying the additive-only changes into the worktree and reverting the main repo's working tree with `git checkout --` (no commits had reached main; its history was never touched). All subsequent edits used worktree-relative paths.

## Verification
- `cargo test --lib commands::review`: 26 passed (9 new + 17 existing), 0 failed.
- `just cargo-test` (full backend suite): all binaries green, 0 failed.
- `just clippy` (`-D warnings`): clean.
- `cargo fmt --check`: clean.
- Source assertions: `grep -c "fn mutate_session_rmw"` = 1; `grep -c 'app.emit("session-changed"'` = 7 (baseline 6 + add_comment, save_draft_comment has none); `grep -c "commands::review::add_comment\|commands::review::save_draft_comment"` in lib.rs = 2.

## Threat Surface
- T-67-01 (text→JSON store): carried forward Phase 65 store guarantees (atomic write, no new sink). No change.
- T-67-02 (path traversal): locked by `add_comment_path_traversal_round_trips_without_affecting_filename` — `../../etc/passwd` round-trips as metadata and the session filename remains the FNV-1a hash. No new surface beyond the planned threat register.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase 68 (full-file anchor) can reuse `add_comment`/`add_comment_inner` verbatim — the L-08 contract is locked by a Rust test asserting `Source::FullFile` persists unchanged.
- The frontend (Plan 03/04) can `safeInvoke("add_comment", { path, text, anchor, cachedExcerpt })` and `safeInvoke("save_draft_comment", { path, text, anchor })`; both commands are registered.
