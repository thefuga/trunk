# Trunk

## What This Is

Trunk is a fast, native, cross-platform desktop Git GUI built with Tauri 2 + Svelte 5 + Rust. It provides a GitKraken-quality visual commit graph with cubic bezier curves and SVG overlay architecture, branch management, staging workflow, remote operations, and file diffs — without the performance penalties or licensing costs of existing tools like GitKraken or Fork.

## Core Value

A developer can open any Git repository, browse its full commit history as a visual graph, stage files, and create commits — all without touching the terminal.

- **v0.7**: Hunk Staging & Search — stage/unstage individual hunks, cmd+f search
- **v0.8**: Conflict & Rebase — conflict diffs, conflict resolution, interactive rebase
- **v0.9**: Multi-tab — functional multi-repo tabs

### Out of Scope

- Settings/preferences UI — deferred to v1.0
- Commit signing — deferred to v1.0
- Auto-updates — deferred to v1.0
- Mobile / web versions — desktop only

## Context

- **Stack**: Tauri 2 + Svelte 5 (Vite SPA, not SvelteKit) + Rust with `git2` crate (libgit2 bindings)
- **Current state**: Shipped v0.5 with ~6,038 LOC Rust, ~4,417 LOC Svelte, ~1,102 LOC TypeScript, ~1,463 LOC Tests. 26 phases complete across 5 milestones.
- **Architecture**: Svelte UI communicates with Rust backend via Tauri `invoke` (commands) and `listen` (events). Rust holds `RepoState` (path-keyed PathBuf registry), `CommitCache` (cached GraphResult with max_columns), `WatcherState` (filesystem watchers), and `RunningOp` (active remote process PID) in managed state.
- **Remote ops**: `git2` for all local read/write; git CLI subprocess for remote operations (fetch/pull/push) and cherry-pick/revert with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` + `GIT_SSH_COMMAND=ssh -o BatchMode=yes`
- **Graph rendering (v0.5)**: Single SVG overlay spanning full graph height inside virtual list scroll container. Rust lane algorithm (O(n), ~5ms for 10k commits) outputs GraphCommit[]; TypeScript Active Lanes transformation computes global grid coordinates with edge coalescing. Cubic bezier curves for cross-lane connections, continuous vertical rails for same-lane. Three-layer z-ordered `<g>` groups (rails → edges → dots). Virtualized element filtering with O(1) range-intersection. SVG ref pills with Canvas text measurement and hover expansion.
- **Graph UI**: 6-column resizable layout (ref, graph, message, author, date, SHA) with LazyStore-persisted widths, native Tauri context menu for column visibility, lane-colored ref pills
- **Patterns established**: inner-fn pattern for testable Tauri commands, safeInvoke<T> for all IPC, sequence counter for stale async guard, cache-repopulate-before-emit for mutation commands, LazyStore for UI state persistence, sentinel oid ('__wip__', '__stash_N__') for synthetic virtual list items, $derived.by() for imperative reactive computations, shared $state rune modules for cross-component communication, InputDialog $state dialogConfig pattern
- **Motivation**: Personal learning project (Tauri/Rust/Svelte) + building a better tool for personal use + eventual open source release

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Tauri 2 + Svelte 5 + Rust — already chosen, non-negotiable
- **Frontend framework**: Plain Vite+Svelte (not SvelteKit) — desktop app has no routing/SSR needs
- **Git backend**: `git2 = "0.19"` for all local operations
- **Filesystem watching**: `notify = "7"` + `notify-debouncer-mini = "0.5"` with 300ms debounce
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + forced dark theme via CSS custom properties
- **Graph**: Virtual scrolling — render only visible rows + dynamic buffer; ~40 DOM nodes for any history size

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Vite+Svelte over SvelteKit | Desktop app has no routing or SSR needs; SvelteKit adds unnecessary complexity | ✓ Good — eliminated entire class of build issues |
| git2 for reads/writes, git CLI for remotes (future) | libgit2 has unreliable SSH/HTTPS auth; all major Tauri git clients shell out for push/pull | ✓ Good — all local ops work reliably |
| Graph lane algorithm in Rust | O(n), avoids serializing intermediate data, doesn't block JS thread | ✓ Good — ~5ms for 10k commits, required 3 gap-closure iterations |
| Inline SVG per row (not Canvas) | Free scrolling, text selection, accessibility; simple enough geometry | ✓ Good — works well with virtual list |
| Virtual scrolling with dynamic buffer | Constant DOM nodes regardless of history size | ✓ Good — smooth performance on large repos |
| `dirty_workdir` error code for checkout | Structured error codes let frontend show contextual UI without string matching | ✓ Good — clean error handling pattern |
| RepoState stores PathBuf only | git2::Repository is not Sync; open fresh per command in spawn_blocking | ✓ Good — avoids lifetime issues, minimal overhead |
| inner-fn pattern for Tauri commands | Separates Tauri state from pure git logic, enables direct unit testing | ✓ Good — all commands testable without Tauri runtime |
| Cache repopulate before emit | Prevents CommitGraph remount from racing a cleared cache | ✓ Good — eliminated race conditions in commit/amend flows |
| DiffPanel replaces CommitGraph (toggle not split) | User feedback found split pane confusing | ✓ Good — simpler UX |

| Lanes removed, dots only for v0.1 | v0.1 lane rendering had visual bugs; simpler to ship dots and revisit with dedicated focus | ✓ Good — shipped v0.1 clean, dedicated v0.2 milestone for graph |
| GraphResult wrapper return type | walk_commits returns struct with commits + max_columns metadata instead of bare Vec | ✓ Good — enables consistent SVG widths, clean separation |
| GraphResponse IPC struct at command boundary | Separate from internal GraphResult; slices commits for pagination | ✓ Good — clean internal/external type separation |
| Branch color counter with deterministic color_index | HEAD gets 0, new branches get incrementing colors, freed columns remove entries | ✓ Good — enables consistent per-branch coloring in frontend |
| Three-layer SVG rendering (rails -> edges -> dots) | Correct z-stacking: rails behind edges behind dots; each layer is a separate SVG group | ✓ Good — clean visual layering, easy to add new element types |
| Manhattan routing for merge/fork edges | Horizontal + arc + vertical path segments with 6px corner radius; simpler than full bezier | ✓ Good — clean visual appearance, straightforward path math |
| Vivid 8-color dark-theme palette | GitHub-dark-inspired high-contrast colors replacing low-contrast originals | ✓ Good — all colors readable against #0d1117 |
| WIP sentinel oid ('__wip__') | Synthetic virtual list item rather than extending GraphCommit type | ✓ Good — keeps TypeScript type aligned with Rust backend struct |
| LazyStore for UI state persistence | Column widths and visibility persisted via Tauri store with lazy load | ✓ Good — consistent pattern for all UI state |
| Native Tauri Menu API over custom Svelte component | Replaced HeaderContextMenu.svelte with @tauri-apps/api/menu | ✓ Good — native look and feel, simpler code |
| git CLI for cherry-pick/revert (not git2) | Avoids reimplementing conflict state machine; consistent with remote ops pattern | ✓ Good — conflict detection via exit code |
| Two-pass stash OID resolution | stash_foreach collects into Vec, parent resolution after foreach releases mutable borrow | ✓ Good — clean borrow checker compliance |
| Stash sentinel OID (__stash_N__) | Extends WIP sentinel pattern for synthetic graph rows; square dots differentiate from commits | ✓ Good — reuses established pattern |
| Store child PID (u32) not tokio::process::Child | Child is !Sync; storing PID in RunningOp enables kill from any thread | ✓ Good — clean async cancellation |
| Ahead/behind inside list_refs_inner | Compute in existing map closure to avoid extra IPC round-trip | ✓ Good — no performance impact on sidebar refresh |
| isUndoing/isRedoing flags for redo stack | Prevents clearRedoStack during undo/redo-triggered repo-changed events | ✓ Good — eliminated race condition |
| Shared $state rune module (remote-state.svelte.ts) | Cross-component state for StatusBar/Toolbar without props/bindings | ✓ Good — clean Svelte 5 pattern |
| Unicode symbols for toolbar icons | Simple, no SVG assets needed, consistent with dark theme | ✓ Good — minimal complexity |
| Reverse "no full-height SVG" (v0.4 out-of-scope) | v0.4 per-row viewBox clipping worked but limited; single overlay enables continuous bezier paths, eliminates row-boundary seams | ✓ Good — single overlay cleaner than per-row, native scroll sync eliminated JS sync code |
| Rust lane algorithm stays, TS transformation added | Rust O(n) algorithm is proven (~5ms/10k commits); TS layer transforms output into global grid coords for SVG rendering | ✓ Good — edge coalescing reduces O(commits x lanes) to O(lanes + merge_edges) |
| Canvas measureText for SVG ref pills | OffscreenCanvas for DOM-free text measurement with injectable mock for testing | ✓ Good — deterministic tests, accurate text sizing |
| SVG ref pills with HTML hover overlay | SVG handles static pills, HTML sibling handles hover expansion for reliable multi-ref display | ✓ Good — avoids SVG text layout complexity |
