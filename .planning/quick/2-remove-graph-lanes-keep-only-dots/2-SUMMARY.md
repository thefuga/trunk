# Quick Task 2: Remove Graph Lanes, Keep Only Dots - Summary

Stripped all SVG edge rendering (straight lines, Bezier fork/merge curves) from LaneSvg.svelte and the WIP row connecting line from CommitGraph.svelte, leaving only commit dot circles. This is a teardown step to prepare for a lane rendering rewrite.

## Task Completion

| Task | Name | Commit | Files Modified |
|------|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Strip edge rendering from LaneSvg and WIP row | bd6dcea | LaneSvg.svelte, CommitGraph.svelte |

## Changes Made

### LaneSvg.svelte
- Removed the entire `{#each commit.edges as edge}` block containing Straight `<line>` elements and ForkLeft/ForkRight/MergeLeft/MergeRight `<path>` Bezier curves
- Removed the `maxCol` derived value (was computing max across commit column and all edge columns)
- Replaced `svgWidth` with simplified derivation: `(commit.column + 1) * laneWidth`
- Preserved the `<circle>` commit dot with all its styling (column position, merge vs normal radius, color, stroke)

### CommitGraph.svelte
- Removed the `<line>` element from the WIP row SVG that drew a vertical connecting line down to the first commit row
- Updated comment to reflect the line removal
- Preserved the hollow `<circle>` WIP dot unchanged

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification Results

1. `svelte-check` passes with no new errors (1 pre-existing type error in SvelteVirtualList bind:this typing, unrelated)
2. `grep -c '<line\|<path' LaneSvg.svelte` = 0 (no edge elements)
3. `grep -c '<line' CommitGraph.svelte` = 0 (no line elements)
4. `grep -c '<circle' LaneSvg.svelte` = 1 (commit dot preserved)
5. `grep -c '<circle' CommitGraph.svelte` = 1 (WIP dot preserved)
6. Backend Rust code and TypeScript types remain unchanged
