# Quick Task 8: Overflow Pill Expand Animation Anchor To Summary

**CSS max-width/max-height/opacity transition on the overflow pill expanded overlay, anchored top-left and expanding right and downward**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~3 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-10T00:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-10T00:03:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Replaced `{#if refHovered && commit.refs.length > 1}` hard DOM insert/remove with always-in-DOM overlay
- Overlay now smoothly expands right and downward from the top-left anchor on hover
- Smooth collapse on mouse leave via reverse CSS transition
- No layout shift: collapsed view (first pill + +N badge) stays rendered at all times

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Animate overflow pill overlay with top-left anchor CSS transition** - c685e32

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/components/CommitRow.svelte` - Replaced hard Svelte if/else show/hide with always-in-DOM overlay using CSS max-width/max-height/opacity transitions

## Decisions Made
- Used always-in-DOM pattern (CSS show/hide) instead of Svelte `{#if}` so CSS transitions can animate the enter/exit states — `{#if}` hard-inserts/removes DOM nodes so there is no CSS state to transition from
- Anchor changed from `top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2` to `top-1` so the top-left corner stays fixed and expansion goes right/down
- `pointer-events: none` when collapsed prevents the invisible (zero-size) overlay from blocking row clicks

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Animation ready for UAT
- User must verify smooth expand/collapse on a commit row with multiple refs before commit is created
