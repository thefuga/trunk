# Quick Task 7: Transform Overflow Pill into Vertical List Summary

**One-liner:** Converted hover-expanded ref overlay from horizontal rounded-full pill row to a vertical rounded-lg dropdown with one full-width pill per line.

## What Was Done

Transformed the hover overlay that shows all refs on a multi-ref commit from a horizontal pill-shaped container into a vertically-stacked rounded-rectangle popup.

### Changes Made

**src/components/CommitRow.svelte (expanded overlay div):**
- `rounded-full` -> `rounded-lg` (square-ish container shape)
- `flex items-center gap-1` -> `flex flex-col` (vertical stack layout)
- `px-2 py-0.5` -> `px-2 py-1.5` (more vertical breathing room)

**src/components/RefPill.svelte (showAll branch):**
- `flex items-center gap-1` -> `flex flex-col gap-0.5` (vertical stack)
- Added `w-full` to each ref `<span>` so pills stretch full overlay width

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification

- `npm run check` passes (pre-existing error in CommitGraph.svelte unrelated to these changes; no new errors introduced)
- Overlay now renders as a vertical rounded-rectangle dropdown with one pill per row
