/**
 * Owns Review-mode center-pane state and the jump action (D-07).
 *
 * Per UI-SPEC:133 the review panel claims the CENTER pane; a jump is a
 * single-pane swap (panel -> diff -> back via the "Review" toggle), NOT a
 * relocation to the right pane. `rightPaneMode` names which of {panel, diff}
 * the center pane currently shows; `reviewActive` tracks whether the review
 * session is the active center-pane context.
 *
 * This module is a pure state+action factory: it never imports RepoView and
 * never reaches into its internals. `jumpTo` composes injected callbacks
 * (`JumpDeps`) that Plan 05 binds to RepoView's concrete selection/scroll
 * machinery, keeping the rune decoupled from the component.
