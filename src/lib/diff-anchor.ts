/**
 * Pure capture-time adapter: translates an in-memory diff line selection into
 * a stable source-coordinate `Anchor` plus a diff-format `cachedExcerpt`.
 *
 * All functions are pure (no side effects, no IPC, no mutation of inputs) and
 * fully tested. The diff comment composer (Plan 02) imports `buildDiffAnchor`
 * to turn a user's line selection into the payload for the `add_comment`
 * command, which stays a dumb writer.
 *
 * Two outputs diverge on purpose (RESEARCH Pitfall 3):
 * - `anchor.start_line..end_line` is min..max over the chosen side's line
 *   numbers, so dropped Delete lines never widen a New-side range (L-03).
 * - `cachedExcerpt` is built over the contiguous min..max INDEX span of the
 *   selection, so dropped `-` lines and in-between context still appear (L-06).
