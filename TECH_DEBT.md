## A. Tracked & ready

### A1 — ✅ CLOSED as OBSOLETE (2026-06-05) — Clean-tree snapshot changeless commit
- **Source:** `.planning/todos/done/2026-05-31-snapshot-empty-working-tree-no-op-guard.md`
- **Why obsolete:** the flow no longer exists. `add_working_tree_review` was
  removed in the 260531-l02 refactor; the only snapshot entry point is now
  `ensure_review_snapshot` (`commands/review.rs`), invoked solely at
  **comment-submit** time from `resolveCommentCommitOid` (`DiffPanel.svelte`).
  Reaching it requires commenting on a real diff hunk, so the tree is never clean
  there — the "changeless entry in the commit list" symptom can't occur as filed.
  The only residual is a narrow TOCTOU (revert while the composer is open, then
  submit); that submit path already toasts any error (`DiffPanel.svelte:260`).
  Not worth speculative defensive code (YAGNI). Reopen if the TOCTOU guard is
  wanted as defense-in-depth.

## B. Structural — oversized files

These are not bugs; they are leaky abstractions that slow every future change.
Pay by *mechanical extraction behind passing tests* (refactor on green), never
by rewriting behavior.

### B1 — 🟡 PARTIAL — `commands/review.rs` was 2687 lines
- **Done (pure cores extracted, behind green):**
  - `review/range.rs` in `5ac15c1` — selection algebra (validate_range,
    compute_range_oids, apply_add/remove, union_dedup, intersect_graph_order) +
    12 tests + range fixtures.
  - `review/resolution.rs` in `ec37588` — orphan classifier (OrphanReason,
    CommentResolution, classify_anchor, resolve_all) + 10 tests; re-exported so
    `git/review.rs`'s import path holds.
  - review.rs: **2687 → 1873 lines** (−30%). Pure moves, no behavior change.
- **Deferred deliberately:** splitting the stateful Tauri command wrappers
  (session lifecycle, comments, RMW). The two pure cores were the high-value,
  low-risk slice.
- **Dependency-on-E2 corrected (2026-06-05):** the original note said "gate the
  split on E2 — command-wrapper tests first." That was written when E2 looked
  ~0%. The logic under the wrappers is now well-tested (106 tests; see E2), so
  the split is **low-risk today**, and the only untested branches live *inside*
  the wrappers and can't be tested until they're extracted to `_inner`.
  Extraction IS the testability fix — the split and the E2-residual tests are
  one move, not sequential.
- Note: the integration binary in `src-tauri/tests/` compiles independently — a
  filtered `cargo test --lib` will lie; verify with full `just check` (MEMORY).

### B2 — `git/review.rs` is 1746 lines, monolithic `render()`
- **Severity:** med · **Effort:** medium
- **Problem:** One `render()` (`git/review.rs:357`) partitions comments, builds
  markdown, groups by file/commit, handles orphans, emits fences — plus
  `fence_length()`/`fence_language()` helpers.
- **Fix:** Extract a `MarkdownBuilder { session, repo, resolved_comments }` with
  `add_header()` / `add_commits_section()` / `add_comments_section()`. Makes the
  pipeline unit-testable incrementally (and would help pay D-test gaps below).

### B3 — `CommitGraph.svelte` is 2069 lines
- **Severity:** med · **Effort:** large
- **Problem:** Largest component by far; mixes layout geometry, column auto-fit,
  rendering, and event handling. Four separate `$effect` blocks
  (`CommitGraph.svelte:250,263,272,281`) each `untrack`-read `columnWidths` and
  write back, causing multiple reactive passes for one logical concern.
- **Fix:** Two independent slices: (a) collapse the four width-fit effects into a
  single `$derived.by(...)` that reads all inputs once and writes once;
  (b) extract pure geometry/path helpers into `$lib` (the v0.5 pure-pipeline
  pattern already established for graph rendering).

### B4 — Other large components (lower priority)
- `StagingPanel.svelte` (1349), `RebaseEditor.svelte` (1041), `RepoView.svelte`
  (983), `ReviewPanel.svelte` (954). Address opportunistically when touching them.

## C. Backend duplication & error handling

### C1 — ✅ PAID (working tree, uncommitted) — `open_repo` duplicated across 10 command modules
- **Severity:** high · **Effort:** small · **Verified:** 10 definitions
  (`diff.rs:15`, `operation_state.rs:26`, `repo.rs:18`, `commit_actions.rs:23`,
  `staging.rs:9`, `branches.rs:15`, `merge_editor.rs:9`, `commit.rs:19`,
  `stash.rs:11`, `interactive_rebase.rs:19`)
- **Problem:** Same logic (state-map lookup → `not_open` error → `Repository::open`)
  copied 10×, under **two different names** — a hesitation smell. Any change to
  the open/error contract is shotgun surgery across 10 files.
- **Fix:** One `pub(crate) fn open_repo_from_state(...)` in `git/` (or
  `commands/mod.rs`); delete the 9 copies; settle on one name.

### C2 — ✅ PAID (working tree, uncommitted) — Error→JSON serialization boilerplate
- **Severity:** high · **Effort:** small · **Verified:** 94 occurrences of
  `serde_json::to_string(&TrunkError…)` across `commands/` (review.rs 20,
  staging.rs 16, commit_actions.rs 11, operation_state.rs 9, diff.rs 6, …)
- **Problem:** Every command wrapper hand-serializes its error and `.unwrap()`s
  the serialization. Brittle (a serialize failure panics) and noisy.
- **Fix:** Extract `fn to_json_err(code: &str, msg: impl ToString) -> String` in
  `error.rs` and use everywhere; drop the `.unwrap()` for an infallible fallback.
  Optional follow-up: a `wrap_command!` macro or a Tauri responder type so
  wrappers stop hand-serializing entirely.

### C3 — ✅ PAID (working tree, uncommitted) — `is_dirty` duplicated verbatim
- **Severity:** med · **Effort:** trivial · **Verified:** `commit_actions.rs:33`
  and `branches.rs:27` (identical signature + body)
- **Problem:** The definition of "dirty repo" lives in two places.
- **Fix:** Move to `git/` as `pub(crate) fn is_repo_dirty(repo) -> Result<bool, …>`;
  import in both.

### C4 — ~~`not_open` error code overloaded~~ — DISMISSED on inspection (2026-06-04)
- An audit pass flagged `not_open` as overloaded for both repo and session
  lookups. **Not true:** `not_open` appears only at `review.rs:73` and `:1094`,
  both "Repository not open" (repo-map misses); session misses already use a
  distinct `no_session` code (8 sites: `review.rs:465,714,757,846,1074,1140,1175,1232`).
  The taxonomy is already clean. Kept as a record that this was checked.

### C5 — ✅ PAID in `7a6f10f` — Internal helpers marked `pub` for testability
- **Severity:** low · **Effort:** trivial
- **Problem:** `validate_range` (`review.rs:193`), `compute_range_oids` (`:223`),
  `apply_add` (`:248`), `apply_remove` (`:255`), `union_dedup` (`:262`),
  `intersect_graph_order` (`:273`) are `pub` but only used in-crate — they read
  as public API.
- **Fix:** Narrow to `pub(crate)`. (Recall the MEMORY footgun: after changing
  visibility/signatures, verify with `just check`, not filtered `--lib`.)

---

## D. Frontend — project-rule violations & type safety

### D1 — ✅ PAID (working tree, uncommitted) — Inline error-color hex violated "never inline colors"
- **Severity:** high · **Effort:** small · **Verified:** 26 inline `#rrggbb` in
  `src/components/*.svelte`
- **Problem:** The error box `background:#3d1c1c; border:1px solid #6b2a2a;
  color:#f87171` is pasted verbatim in `BranchRow.svelte:81`,
  `CommitGraph.svelte:1737`, `WelcomeScreen.svelte:88`; bare `color:#f87171`
  error text in `CommitForm.svelte:171,194`, `BranchSidebar.svelte:653`,
  `CommitGraph.svelte:2025`. **These are out-of-sync near-duplicates of tokens
  that already exist** — `--color-danger` (`#f87171`), `--color-danger-bg`,
  `--color-danger-border` (`src/app.css:55-57`).
- **Fix:** Add an `.error-box` / `.error-text` class (or a small `<ErrorBox>` /
  `<ErrorText>` component) backed by the existing `--color-danger*` tokens;
  replace all 26 inline literals. Direct CLAUDE.md-rule cleanup.

### D2 — ✅ PAID — File-status color hex in component maps
- **The twist:** the audit's "duplicated map" was half **dead code**. The
  `CommitDetail.svelte` `STATUS_ICONS` map (`DiffStatus`-keyed) was defined but
  **referenced nowhere** (the live render uses `DIFF_STATUS_MAP`). So there was no
  real duplication to reconcile.
- **What shipped (zero visual change):** (1) deleted the dead `STATUS_ICONS` map +
  its now-unused `DiffStatus` import from CommitDetail (removes 7 hex literals);
  (2) extracted `--color-status-{new,modified,deleted,renamed,typechange,conflicted}`
  tokens in `app.css` at the **exact** current values; (3) pointed the live
  `FileRow` `STATUS_ICON_COMPONENTS` map at `var(--color-status-*)`.
- **Deliberately NOT done:** the greens *differ* (`#4ade80` add vs `#22c55e` new) —
  that's a discrepancy, not duplication. Unifying them is an aesthetic call, kept
  out of this refactor (and now moot since the dead map is gone). The coincidental
  `#facc15` (Untracked vs Conflicted) is two separate tokens by meaning, not merged.
- **Remaining (D2b, tiny):** the FileRow stage/unstage button (`:117`) still has
  inline `#22c55e/#f87171` — action-coloring, a separate concern from the status
  map; left as a noted one-off.

### D3 — `VirtualList` piggybacks state via `as unknown as` casts (6 sites)
- **Severity:** high · **Effort:** small · **Verified:**
  `VirtualList.svelte:165,167,169,190,192,197`
- **Problem:** Pending height deltas are stashed on `heightManager.viewport`
  under a string key via `"__svl_pendingHeightAdj__" as unknown as keyof
  HTMLElement` and `viewport as unknown as Record<string, number>`. Defeats
  TS strict mode on a hot scroll path; a refactor of `viewport` breaks silently.
- **Fix:** Give the height manager an explicit `pendingDelta` field with
  `getPendingDelta()` / `addDelta(n)` / `clearPending()`; delete the cast chain.

### D4 — ✅ PAID in `63b1756` — `rgba()`/shadow literals not tokenized
- **Severity:** low · **Effort:** small · **Verified:** 5 `rgba(` literals in
  components (drop-shadows in `PullDropdown.svelte:139`, `SearchBar.svelte:67`,
  `RebaseEditor.svelte`; search highlight in `CommitRow.svelte`)
- **Fix:** Add `--shadow-sm/-md/-lg` and `--color-search-current/-other` tokens to
  `app.css`; reference via `var()`. Folds into D1.

### D5 — `RepoView` layout prop-drilling
- **Severity:** med · **Effort:** medium
- **Problem:** `RepoView.svelte` threads ~9 pane-geometry props + their
  `on*change` callbacks from `App.svelte`. Adding a pane/gesture adds more
  callbacks through the chain.
- **Fix:** A `layout-state.svelte.ts` rune owning pane geometry (mirrors the
  existing `review-session.svelte.ts` pattern); `RepoView` imports it directly.

---

## E. Test & tooling debt

### E1 — ✅ PAID — `diff_commit` command had no production caller
- **Decision:** deleted the command wrapper. The trace showed the test drivers
  call `diff_commit_inner` **directly** (`tests/common/drivers/diff.rs:42,55`),
  not the command — so the `diff_commit` *command* (diff.rs) was referenced only
  by its `lib.rs` registration: zero real callers. Removed the wrapper + the
  registration line; kept `diff_commit_inner` and every test/driver (they exercise
  the inner). Net: one less registered IPC command (less surface), zero test loss.

### E2 — 🟢 LOGIC-LAYER PAID (re-audited 2026-06-05) — review system test coverage
- **Stale framing corrected:** the 2026-06-04 entry ("session lifecycle only, no
  coverage for commit/comment/snapshot/doc-gen") predated the B1 third-pass test
  batch and overstated the gap ~10×. The behaviors it lists are **all covered at
  the logic layer**. Verified `#[test]` counts (2026-06-05): `commands/review.rs`
  24, `git/review.rs` 31, `review/range.rs` 12, `review/resolution.rs` 10,
  `git/workdir_snapshot.rs` 11, `git/review_store.rs` 6, `tests/test_review.rs`
  12 — **106 total**.
- **Behavior → where tested:** add/remove review commit (`*_rmw`, review.rs incl.
  `:1205`) · add/edit/delete/draft/commit comment (14 inline tests) · resolve
  (`resolve_all`, resolution.rs ×10) · snapshot (workdir_snapshot.rs ×11) ·
  doc-gen (`render`, git/review.rs ×31 incl. 14 goldens) · selection algebra
  (range.rs ×12) · session store/lifecycle (review_store + test_review.rs).
- **Genuine residual (small):** the untested branches live *inside* the
  `#[tauri::command]` bodies, above the `_inner` seam line — `ensure_review_snapshot`
  Index-kind dispatch + `bad_request` parse; `generate_review_doc` `no_comments`/
  `no_session` gates; `resolve_session_comments` `no_session` gate; and the
  `no_session` precheck **duplicated** between `seed_review_range`/`ensure_review_snapshot`
  and their inner.
- **Dependency w/ B1 is INVERTED (see B1):** these branches aren't testable under
  the project's `_inner` convention as-is (they need `State`/`AppHandle`;
  `mock_app()` is reserved for the watcher tests because `MockRuntime` drops
  `emit()`→`listen()`). Extracting them into `_inner` seams *is* the B1 wrapper
  split — not a precursor to it. Pay E2-residual and B1-wrappers as one move.

### E3 — `operation_state` / `commit_actions` thinly tested
- **Severity:** med · **Effort:** medium · **Verified:** `operation_state.rs`
  (903 LOC vs 213 test LOC); `commit_actions.rs` (823 vs 273)
- **Problem:** Merge/rebase state machines and undo/redo/cherry-pick/reset cover
  happy paths; missing corrupt-state recovery, abort cleanup, dirty-tree resets,
  conflict handling.
- **Fix:** Add edge-case tests per the gaps above.

### E4 — `--lib`-passes-while-integration-fails footgun unguarded in CI
- **Severity:** med · **Effort:** small · **Verified:** `justfile` cargo-test;
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; documented in MEMORY (hit on 76-01)
- **Problem:** `cargo test --lib <module>` can pass green while the independent
  `src-tauri/tests/` integration binary fails to compile against a renamed
  symbol. Nothing enforces the full build.
- **Fix:** Ensure CI runs the full `cargo test` (lib + integration) and treats
  integration-compile failure as a gate. Already noted in CLAUDE.md/MEMORY —
  make it a CI assertion, not tribal knowledge.
- **Partial hardening (`6883c6b`, adjacent — NOT a full E4 fix):** the `clippy`
  recipe now runs `--all-targets`, so tests + benches + the integration binary
  are linted under `-D warnings`. Previously lib-only, so `#[cfg(test)]` warnings
  (e.g. the unused `git2` import in the B1 work) passed `just check` green and
  surfaced only on a raw `cargo test`. This closes the *lint* blind spot; the
  *compile/run* gate (E4 proper — CI asserting full `cargo test`) is still open.

### E5 — Component test files dwarf their components
- **Severity:** low · **Effort:** medium · **Verified:** `DiffPanel.test.ts`
  (1861) vs `DiffPanel.svelte` (877); `ReviewPanel.test.ts` (1539) vs
  `ReviewPanel.svelte` (954)
- **Problem:** Heavy `invoke` mocking + manual promise sequencing suggests tests
  assert implementation (mock call counts, state transitions) over behavior —
  fragile under refactor.
- **Fix:** Shift toward role/text queries; extract shared mock factories. Low
  priority — only when these tests start blocking refactors.

### E6 — Doc drift: CLAUDE.md doesn't list active Tauri plugins
- **Severity:** low · **Effort:** trivial
- **Fix:** `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` enables specific plugins (dialog, store,
  window-state, clipboard); CLAUDE.md says only "Tauri 2". List them.

---

## Suggested order

1. **Quick wins (one sitting):** C3, C1, C2, D1 — high-payoff dedup + the
   CLAUDE-rule color cleanup. Low risk, big readability gain.
2. **Scoped fix:** A1 (the tracked todo) + its `ReviewPanel` gate test.
3. **Type safety:** D3.
4. **Structural, behind green:** B1 → B2, then add E2 tests in the same pass.
5. **Backstop:** E4 (CI gate) so the integration footgun can't recur.

## Paid

_Append `- [ID] paid in <sha> — note` as items are closed._

- **C1** paid in `d470cba` — extracted `commands::open_repo_from_state`; deleted 9
  duplicate local fns across diff/operation_state/staging/branches/commit_actions/
  commit/merge_editor/stash/interactive_rebase. `repo.rs::open_repo` (the Tauri
  command) and the new shared helper are the only `open_repo*` left.
- **C2** paid in `d470cba` — added `TrunkError::to_json()` (infallible, no panic);
  converted **197** sites (`&e` + `&TrunkError::new(...)`) across 14 command files.
  Removes ~197 `.unwrap()` panic points on the error path.
- **C3** paid in `d470cba` — extracted `git::repository::is_repo_dirty`; deleted
  both local `is_dirty` copies (branches, commit_actions).
- **D1** paid in `59f6353` — moved 16 error-context hex literals into scoped
  `.error-banner`/`.error-text` classes backed by `--color-danger*` tokens across
  6 components (incl. Toast.svelte). **Visual note:** error-box backgrounds shift
  opaque→translucent (intentional convergence to the design system). Status-color
  maps (D2) left untouched.
- **C5** paid in `7a6f10f` — narrowed the 6 review.rs helpers to `pub(crate)`
  (verified not used by the integration test crate first).
- **D4** paid in `63b1756` — added `--shadow-sm/-md/-lg` and
  `--color-search-current/-match`; swapped the rgba literals in PullDropdown,
  SearchBar, RebaseEditor, CommitRow. Token values byte-equal the literals — zero
  visual change.
- All paydowns verified by `just check` (fmt, biome, svelte-check, clippy
  `-D warnings`, cargo-test, vitest) — green.

### Second pass (2026-06-05)
- **C5** paid in `7a6f10f`; **D4** paid in `63b1756` (see above).
- **D2** paid — the "duplicate map" was half dead code; deleted the dead
  `CommitDetail.STATUS_ICONS`, tokenized the live `FileRow` map at exact values
  (zero visual change). Green-unification deliberately left as an aesthetic call.
- **E1** paid — deleted the caller-less `diff_commit` command wrapper + its
  `lib.rs` registration; kept `diff_commit_inner` and all tests.
- **A1** closed as **obsolete** — filed flow (`add_working_tree_review`) was
  removed in a refactor; todo moved to `.planning/todos/done/`.

### Third pass (2026-06-05)
- **B1** partial — extracted the two pure cores `review/range.rs` (`5ac15c1`) and
  `review/resolution.rs` (`ec37588`); review.rs 2687→1873 (−30%). Wrapper split
  deferred behind E2 (see B1 entry).
- **E4** partial (`6883c6b`) — hardened the clippy gate with `--all-targets` so
  test/bench/integration warnings can't pass green; fixed the 5 pre-existing
  test-code warnings it surfaced. Lint blind spot closed; the CI full-`cargo test`
  assertion (E4 proper) remains open. See E4 entry.

### Still open
- B1 wrappers (+ E2-residual, one move — see corrected B1/E2 notes), B2
  (`git/review.rs` render split), B3 (CommitGraph), D3 (VirtualList casts), D5
  (RepoView prop-drilling), E3 (test coverage), E4 (CI gate), E5/E6, D2b (FileRow
  button colors). E2 logic-layer paid 2026-06-05.
